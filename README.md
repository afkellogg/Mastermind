# Mastermind

This is a small pet project I'm working on to create a web-based version of the old code-cracking game Mastermind ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game))).

At the moment, this code is purely for the logic side of the game. The idea is that someone can create a UI for the game, and use this code for the logic.

My goal is that once this code is completed, I will create several UIs, each using a different JavaScript framework. This will allow me to see for myself some of the differences between the frameworks, and document my findings for others to (hopefully) benefit from.

## Why Mastermind?

When I was a kid, my dad wrote a few games for my Commodore 64, one of which was Mastermind. So this is a bit of a "tip of the cap" to my dad for making me curious about coding, which eventually lead to me pursuing a career in coding.
